# Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: head = [1,1,2]
# Output: [1,2]
# Example 2:


# Input: head = [1,1,2,3,3]
# Output: [1,2,3]
 

# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
